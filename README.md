# Massive-Volunteering

This is a project I am completing for my Computer Science internal assessment.

Massive Volunteering is a club at McNally that seeks to connect volunteers with community organizations. The difficulty right now with the club is that there any many steps in going from a community organization to the student. I am creating a website that allows organizations to “register” their initiative directly, and students can access the website and see the opportunities instantly!
